# Hitori
This is a simple [Hitori][wikiLink] game solver. 

At the moment, it's just a container for a basic source code that will generate random Hitori puzzles until it finds one that can be solved, and then solves it using BTS and some basic logical/mathematical inferences.

If interested, watch/star the repository and I'll take the project to the next step. There's a lot that can still be done (starting from generating solvable puzzles! =D).
