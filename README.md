# Hitori
This is a simple [Hitori][wikiLink] game automatic creator and solver. 

If interested, take a look at the [article][articleLink] I wrote about it (the code changed since I wrote the article).

Watch/star the repository so that I can take the project to the next step. 
There's a lot that can still be done, like refining the generator in order to create games with **unique** solutions. Or a GUI. Or a mobile app based on this!
